#PLOT: Essentially it is a 12 Question (maybe 10) survey that produces a journal like entry in text doc.
# Future development: Advice for the next day, how I can get dates as input and separate them as 3 integer,
# clothing, activity with list and scale....
#TOMORROW: Fav Season would be good to associated with the days temp
# + Make b_month the t_month or t_day...

#ASK PHIL:
